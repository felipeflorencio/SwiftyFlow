     Flow Manager convenience initialiser
     
     1 - When we are already in one storyboard, and we want to load another viewcontroller
         that is inside this storyboard you can resolve using `rootInstance` to resolve and
         will be set to as your root view controller inside your navigation controller.
     
     Example:
        We have setup our Storyboard, and we embed in on our view controllers our UINavigationController
        Them as we want to use the Flow Manager to handle our navigation, we need to get the reference to our
        view controller and set as our `custom navigation`, but we need to know who is the root of this
        navigation, so for this we pass the `root` type of the view.

     2 - When you are loading a completely new storyboard, as you will need to resolve your
         first / root view controller using the reference from the storyboar as it's not loaded
         yet, so for this scenario you only pass the type of the first one `root` that will be resolved
         so we hande this resolution for you, otherwise will load with a black screen your navigation.

     - Parameters:
        - root: The view controller type that you will have as `root` view controller for you navigation controller.
        - container: It's the `ContainerFlowStack` instance, it's where we will look for the registered View Controller types in order to resolve and show on the screen.
        - withCustom: `optional` - Custom UINavigationController it's optional, if not we will use the default one from UIKit.
        - setupInstance: `optional` - It's how will be our navigation, it's a enum, if you don't set we will assume that is nib view that you will be using.
        - dismissed: `optional` - Closure optional that can tell you when this navigation controller was completely closed.
