    /**
     Flow Manager convenience initialiser for when you want to resolve the root view controller from your navigation controller receiving parameters.
     
     1 - When we are already in one storyboard, and we want to load another viewcontroller
         that is inside this storyboard you can resolve using `rootInstance` to resolve and
         will be set to as your root view controller inside your navigation controller.
     
     Example:
        We have setup our Storyboard, and we embed in on our view controllers our UINavigationController
        Them as we want to use the Flow Manager to handle our navigation, we need to get the reference to our
        view controller and set as our `custom navigation`, but we need to know who is the root of this
        navigation, so for this we pass the `root` type of the view.
     
     2 - When you are loading a completely new storyboard, as you will need to resolve your
         first / root view controller using the reference from the storyboar as it's not loaded
         yet, so for this scenario you only pass the type of the first one `root` that will be resolved
         so we hande this resolution for you, otherwise will load with a black screen your navigation.
     
     - Parameters:
        - root: The view controller type that you will have as `root` view controller for you navigation controller.
        - container: It's the `ContainerFlowStack` instance, it's where we will look for the registered View Controller types in order to resolve and show on the screen.
        - parameters: Closure that expect the parameter that you want to be passed to when we resolve, need to follow the same order and type of the register that is expecting this parameter(s).
        - withCustom: `optional` - Custom UINavigationController it's optional, if not we will use the default one from UIKit.
        - setupInstance: `optional` - It's how will be our navigation, it's a enum, if you don't set we will assume that is nib view that you will be using.
        - dismissed: `optional` - Closure optional that can tell you when this navigation controller was completely closed.

    /**
     This is the method that we will use in order to send parameter when resolve our instance
     Remember that when declare the parameter data that you want to be resolved need to be inside
     Tuple, as for swift when resolve everything need to have a type, with this we make sure that
     always have type and the values are inside
     
     - Parameters:
        - screen: The type of the view controller that you want to next.
        - paramer: Closure that expect a `type` that will be used when resolve this screen that you are calling.
        - resolve: `optional` - How the view for this screen will be loaded, the default one is `.nib`.
        - resolved: `optional` - Convenience closure that will return the loaded instance reference for this loaded view, it's good when you want to set some values or pass any parameter not using the custom resolve, you will have the right reference to pass value.
     
     ### Usage Example: ###
     ````
        // Basic implementation
         navigationFlow?.goNextWith(screen: ParameterFirstViewController.self, parameters: { () -> ((String, Int)) in
            return ("Felipe Garcia", 232)
         })
     
        // Using the parameters available
         navigationFlow?.goNextWith(screen: ParameterFirstViewController.self, parameters: { () -> ((String, Int)) in
            return ("Felipe Garcia", 232)
         }, resolve: .nib, resolved: { resolveView in
            // resolve view
         })
     ````

     can provide is if you implement this method in our class so as soon was instantiated we will
     send and you will be able to receive parameter from the caller.
     
     - Parameter data: Closure that will receive the parameter, you need to declare the types the same order that you are expecting.
