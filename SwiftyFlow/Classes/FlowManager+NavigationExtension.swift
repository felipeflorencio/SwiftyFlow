    /**
     This is the method that we will use in order to send parameter when resolve our instance
     Remember that when declare the parameter data that you want to be resolved need to be inside
     Tuple, as for swift when resolve everything need to have a type, with this we make sure that
     always have type and the values are inside
     
     - Parameters:
        - screen: The type of the view controller that you want to next.
        - paramer: Closure that expect a `type` that will be used when resolve this screen that you are calling.
        - resolve: `optional` - How the view for this screen will be loaded, the default one is `.nib`.
        - resolved: `optional` - Convenience closure that will return the loaded instance reference for this loaded view, it's good when you want to set some values or pass any parameter not using the custom resolve, you will have the right reference to pass value.
     
     ### Usage Example: ###
     ````
        // Basic implementation
         navigationFlow?.goNextWith(screen: ParameterFirstViewController.self, parameters: { () -> ((String, Int)) in
            return ("Felipe Garcia", 232)
         })
     
        // Using the parameters available
         navigationFlow?.goNextWith(screen: ParameterFirstViewController.self, parameters: { () -> ((String, Int)) in
            return ("Felipe Garcia", 232)
         }, resolve: .nib, resolved: { resolveView in

       stack declared.
       
       
       - Parameters:
          - screen: `optional` - The type of the screen that you want to go, need to be registered in your container flow stack.
          - resolve: `optional` - How the view for this screen will be loaded, the default one is `.nib`.
